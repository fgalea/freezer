\section MainIntro Introduction

Freezer is a 3D engine and animation system for the Cell Broadband Engine
processor.

The 3D engine main characteristics are:

- Efficient use of SPE's for display acceleration. Used PPE CPU power is reduced
to the minimum (almost zero).
- Support for triangles, quads, with optional extrusion mechanism for 2D ojects.
- Support for import of 3D objects in OFF file format.
- Available shading types:
  - flat shading
  - gouraud shading
- Accurate Z-buffered rendering.
- Automatic generation of normal vectors for flat-shaded objects, and for
Gouraud-shaded objects.
- No support for textures (yet).

The animation system characteristics are:

- Available output environments: SDL, PS3 framebuffer, or file export for frames
(BMP format).
- Double buffering.
- Eventual support for motion blur and fading effects.
