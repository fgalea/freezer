This is Freezer, a 3D graphics engine for the Cell Broadband Engine processor.

This package contains a library which implements a 3D engine and software
renderer for computers having a Cell Broadband Engine processor, such as
Sony's PlayStation 3.

Requirements
------------
 - A computer with Cell B.E. processor, running a Linux-based operating system.
A PS3 (phat model, with firmware <= 3.15) is the right machine to use. Using an
IBM Cell blade (QS20/QS21/QS22), or even IBM's Cell system simulator should work
aswell, at the price of no video output through framebuffer (you can still try
the SDL output interface, who knows).
 - The required libraries are : libspe2. Yes, that's all.
 - Optional libraries : SDL.

Setup
-----
 - If not compiling Freezer from a tarball, you first need to create the
 required autotools files by running the bootstrap script:
  $ ./bootstrap
 - Configure and build the library:
  $ ./configure
  $ make
 - As the system administrator (commonly known as 'root'), install the library:
  $ make install

Create your own programs
------------------------
For the moment, the documentation is somewhat nonexistent. You still can read
the comments in the code, or start and try to compile and execute the example
programs in the examples/ directory.
